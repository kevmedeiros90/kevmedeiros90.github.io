                "description": "Pros: There's a lot to like here.- Current gen quad core i5- The 960M isn’t going to blow you away but it’s decent enough to play most games of 2015 and similar at a mix of medium/high settings at acceptable frame rates.  Additionally, Dell gave it *4GB* of DDR5 vram, instead of the usual 2gb of DDR5 or even DDR3 you find in this price range.  That's great for newer games and open world games that benefit from more GPU memory.- Very easy for the end user to service - single screw access to all the internals is NICE.- Good upgrade options.  You have a free M.2 SSD slot and a free ram slot, so a couple of simple and cheap upgrades can give you a great spec boost that puts you in line with models that cost several hundred dollars more.-A number of small things that add up: backlit keyboard with a couple of brightness settings, number pad on the keyboard, big battery, red accents give it a good but not overly aggressive look, IPS panel instead of a TN panel, huge rubber feet on the bottom that really work well to keep the laptop from slipping and help with ventilation, indication light on the charger end so you can see if it’s got power, very little bloatware, etc.  It’s a bunch of things that taken on their own might not be a big deal, but together make a pretty compelling bunch of bells and whistles.",

Screen is fine, don't listen to the whiners, it's LED and every angle is excellent, even in sunlight. Boot up time is about 45 seconds, and did I mention that it only takes ONE screw to open up the entire bottom panel and add an m2 drive or another ram. Processor is fine for gaming, honestly.",

I easily added 8gb of RAM( $30 USD) and a 250gb Samsung m.2 SSD($90USD) to beef this laptop up! Samsungs software made transferring the OS super easy to do. Google this laptop and how to upgrade, there is a great video that walks you through the process.*  Backlit led keyboard, keys dim after inactivity to safe battery life* The keys feel good, I don't have any issues with the keyboard",
